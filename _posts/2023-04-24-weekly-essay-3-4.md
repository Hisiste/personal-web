## Introduction

*"What happened to week 1 and 2?"* You may ask. Well, those were written using
Word and sent via e-mail. This essay is different in the sense that *"I'm
making it public!"*. But that's all. In this essay, we will talk about a lot of
different topics and what I've learned during my Apprentice Program at
[Encora](https://www.encora.com/).

## Onboarding

### LTs and Wellbeing

Encora's organization has a horizontal structure. This means, there isn't any
superiors. We all work in groups and we're all at the same 'level'. In this
type of structures, feedback becomes extremely important. This work model is
based in the [WordBlu's model](https://www.worldblu.com/), in which Encora is a
[WorldBlu certified Freedom-Centered Organization](https://www.worldblu.com/encora).

LT
: **L**eadership **T**eam. When projects that affects an entire community are
proposed, LT is consulted to organize the project.

There exists multiple LT teams on Encora.
- Wellbeing.
- LGBTQ+.
- Gender Seminar.
- Encora People Care.

### Operations in a Day

What do operations people do?
1. That you are comfortable with your job.
1. Make sure you have the necessary equipment for your work.
1. Implement plans to achieve the proposed strategies.
    - Each month the company's strategic objectives are presented.

### Do y no tan Do Part II

If you have even the slightest security problem, call IT immediately. Waiting
or trying to solve the problem by yourself may worsen the problem. It's advised
to have the following recommendations in mind:

1. Do a full scan of the computer once **every month**.
1. If your computer is infected, it'll be formatted. **Use cloud services.**
1. A firewall allows or denies incoming or outgoing connections from the
   internet. What would a *"human firewall"* be?
    - The human part is usually the *weakest link in the chain*.
    - Learn how to protect yourself and the company from malicious software.

## Personal blog

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the backbone of this entire website. It
uses [markdown](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to generate static
websites. All of the entries you see in this page were written using markdown.
The community of Jekyll is fairly big, having lots of tutorials on how to use
it and lots of [themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) everyone can use. This
webpage uses the [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

The website is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), making
it easy for me to use a custom domain that I bought before on
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

In less than a week, I learned the basics of Jekyll, used GitHub Pages to host
the webpage and even managed to configure a custom domain for the page. It's
not because I'm some kind of genius, but because every tool that I used was
extremely easy to use and well documented.

## Google Code Jam

As seen with the [other posts](/categories/technical-logs/), we used the
[Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) page to solve
programming challenges in a variety of programming languages. Although it isn't
my first time working with programming challenge websites, it was my first
time solving them in programming languages I had never used and working within
a team.

This adventure made me realize how important communication and organization is.
We had lots of mistakes and misunderstandings because of our lack of
experience. But I truly think those experiences are invaluable for me. They'll
help me grow not only in my job, but even as a person.
